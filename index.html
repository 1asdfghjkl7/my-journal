        <h2>Day 2</h2>
        <p>I learned more about the DOM, and how to create what was an entire html file in javascript. I also got to see cohort 25's projects which were mind blowing but definitely understandable. I don't yet feel completely overwhelmed.</p>

        <h2>Day 5</h2>
        <p>Learned css a bit better. I hate css. Got introduced to flexbox and it makes me hate css slightly less. Got to see some UI/UX grad projects, and they were awesome. Super nervous about capstone project.</p>
